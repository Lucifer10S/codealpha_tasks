# Hangman Game

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic Hangman game. The player has to guess a word by entering letters one at a time. The game keeps track of incorrect guesses and displays a hangman drawing with each wrong guess.

## Features

- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- Tracks correct and incorrect guesses.
- Displays a hangman figure for each incorrect guess.
- Ends when the word is guessed or the player runs out of guesses.

## How to Play

1. Run the `hangman.py` file.
2. The game will show you a word with underscores for the letters.
3. Guess letters one by one.
4. If you guess a correct letter, it will appear in the word.
5. If you guess an incorrect letter, the number of allowed attempts decreases.
6. The game ends when you either guess the word or run out of attempts.
